There are two tasks that were done:
1- Analyse British Airways reviews:
1000 reviews were parsed from the BA website as well as their ratings, each review occupied a row.
The reviews were preprocessed (tokinzed, lemmitized, stop words were removed..).
The wordcloud had shown that most of the reviws had talked about the seats, food, flight services and time 
Also, 67% of the reviews were nagtive ones. 

The softwares and tooks used: LDA topic modeling, gensim, beautiful soup

2- customer booking behavior:
50,000 transactions were analysed through different machine learning models that were evaluated for the best measures to 
understand the customers behavior in complete booking and it was noticed that the purchase lead which is the 
number of days before the flight date is the feature that influences the customer booking completion action. 
hence, it was used to predict the booking completion for future transactions. 
models used: random forest
